//    Create employee (Via POST)
//    Create a Department
//    Update an employee to set their manager
//    Update other employee fields
//    Set a new department manager (Update department)
//    Change the name of a department
//    Get the list of employees under a particular manager
//    Get the entire reporting hierarchy for an employee (their manager + manager's manager etc.)
//            Get a list of employees with no assigned manager
//            Get all employees of a particular department
//            Get all employees who report directly or indirectly to a particular manager
//            This should still work for an employee who is not a manager -- they have no direct reports
//            Remove a particular employee or list of employees
//            Remove all employees from a particular department
//            Remove all employees under a particular manager (Including indirect reports)
//    Remove all direct reports to a manager. Any employees previously managed by the deleted employees should now be managed by the next manager up the hierarchy.
//    Get the department, title, or other attributes of a particular employee.
//            Merge departments (given two department names eg: A and B, move the manager of B to report to the manager of A, and update all other employees to be members of department A)
